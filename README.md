Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a major global health concern and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early detection and accurate prediction of cardiovascular risk factors in individuals play a pivotal role in implementing timely preventive measures and effective healthcare interventions. This project aims to develop a comprehensive and reliable predictive model for assessing the cardiovascular risk in individuals, facilitating proactive healthcare management and reducing the burden of CVDs.

Dataset
The foundation of this project lies in a rich and diverse dataset encompassing an array of health-related features and corresponding cardiovascular outcomes of individuals. The dataset includes essential attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, family history of CVDs, and various other clinical parameters. Collected from diverse sources and meticulously preprocessed, this dataset constitutes a valuable resource for insightful analysis and risk prediction.

Techniques Used
To build an accurate and robust cardiovascular risk prediction model, the project employs a combination of supervised machine learning techniques for classification. The key methodologies include:

Data Preprocessing
Prior to modeling, the dataset undergoes thorough data preprocessing. This step involves data cleaning to handle missing values, outlier detection and treatment, and data normalization or scaling to ensure uniformity across the features.

Feature Selection
With a multitude of features available, identifying the most relevant predictors of cardiovascular risk is crucial. The project utilizes advanced feature selection techniques to discern the influential factors that significantly contribute to risk prediction, enhancing model interpretability and performance.

Model Selection
Several powerful classification algorithms are explored and evaluated to identify the optimal predictive model. Among the algorithms considered are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. Rigorous evaluation metrics are employed to assess each model's performance and choose the most effective one.

Model Evaluation
A comprehensive evaluation of the predictive model is carried out using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics provide valuable insights into the model's ability to correctly identify individuals at risk of cardiovascular diseases and distinguish its performance in differentiating between positive and negative cases.
